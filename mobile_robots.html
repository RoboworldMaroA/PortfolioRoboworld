        <p> Mobile robots</p>
        <br>
        <p>I chose mobile robots because they have many applications, programming is challenging,
          especially when you get to the part of recognising objects with a camera, not to mention mapping and using
          GPS.
          A mobile robot can be extended with an additional arm to pick up objects, so we have a whole spectrum of
          different problems to solve.</p>
        <p> I started to take an interest in building robots in 2008.
          Those were very different times, hardly anyone had heard of Arduino and Raspberry Pi had not yet been born.
          Building a mobile robot required more work than today.
          I started by buying an Atmega development board and a stack of books on programming microcontrollers using
          BASCOM.
          The six-wheeled vehicle programmed, had the ability to be driven by two DC motors and four servos for turning.
          On the front of the vehicle is an obstacle recognition sensor I built.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2009, I noticed that I could use a better solution and the Arduino was it.
          I bought an Arduino Duemilanove which had an ATmega328p on board, a chip with more outputs and inputs than
          the
          ATmega8.
          I experimented a bit with diodes and started building a linefollower,
          I decided that I would postpone the six-wheeler project for another time as it required more work and money
          (let's not forget the crisis). I built this linefollower from what I could find in my home toolbox.
          Converted servo motors (discarded electronics) used as drive, and turning is done by adjusting the speed of
          the driven wheels.
          On the front is a sensor module for colour recognition, on the back is an arduino and a motor controller I
          built (bridge l298d)
          and a colour sensor controller.
        </p>
        <p>Until 2011, in my spare time, I experimented with sonar and obstacle sensors and a sumo robot, but due to
          lack of time,
          I stopped doing mobile robotics and returned to the topic in 2020. I called it the reactivation roboworld,
          I started building a mobile robot, this time 4 wheeled with Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
        <p>
          After research, I realized that it was best if the program was to be written in Python.
          As I had no prior knowledge of the language, I did "Complete Python Developer: Zero to Mastery" and then
          "Master Computer Vision System OpenCV3" these courses were very interesting.
          These 2 months after working hours allowed me to start playing with Raspberry and building a robot that
          recognizes objects.
          As it turned out, the Raspberry Pi 3 has a weak processor and not enough RAM, which makes object recognition
          very slow.
          I started delving into the field of object recognition and found an interesting topic like Tensorflow. I
          used
          Tensorflow Lite and the built-in model on a Raspberry Pi, but the image was still analyzed at 2 frames per
          second.
          That's why I bought a Google Coral accelerator which accelerated to 8 frames per second.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote a program that allowed me to control the robot remotely using a laptop using the arrows on the
          keyboard and in a separate window
          I have a view from the camera. I thought a robot control application would be useful, so I created a Python
          web application and Flask.
          I managed to create a graphically simple interface and deploy it so that I could use the application via the
          Internet.
          Thanks to this, allows me to control the robot using a telephone or computer outside my local network.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used remote.it to connect remotely. In my account, when connecting to the Pi, a 'proxy' link is provided
          through which I connect via a web browser.
          However, this solution has disadvantages such as, huge lags. This option is not suitable for my use.
          I have therefore come to another solution, which is to control the 'Rasperry Pi' via VNC.
          This is a program I use to manage and run the robot remotely, also on a laptop. To make it possible for the
          Pi to connect outside the local network,
          I create a network access point ("sharing") on my phone.
          I can also connect my laptop to the Pi as I have added an extra wifi card which allows me to do this.
        </p>
        <p>Next steps in the project.</p>
        <p>1.Installation of "Tensorflow" on the "Raspberry Pi 4".</p>
        <p>2. Programm for a "line follower" using the camera</p>
        <p>3. Mounting of Sonar - distance recognition experiments already done.</p>
        <p>4. Build a mobile application or improve Web App</p>
